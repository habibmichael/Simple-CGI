TThis is a simple cgi web application. A user navigates to the directiory and is presented with a series of my personal projects and their query string in a list if inputed one.

The project was the first assignment given as part of a senior design class for Cal State Northridge.

At the beginning of starting the project I had to decide what languag I wanted to use. After searching the web and seeing what fits well with cgi scripts, I decided it be between perl or bash. I have never used perl so I decided that I should go with that language to try and learn something new. Getting the web page to display the html and respond to query strings was not difficult and was completed quickly. Througought the project I used git for version control to seperate some logic steps in creating the project.Although very basic I feel the project is complete and meets  the specifiaction.
